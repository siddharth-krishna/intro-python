# Introduction to Programming with Python

This repo contains some notes from a class I taught on Python, along with a static web app I made for solving Python problems in your browser.

## PyDojo

A static web app (frontend only, works offline, small footprint) for solving Python programming exercises in your browser:
https://pydojo.onrender.com/

[Source code](pydojo/)

## Notes

1. [Basics: variables, assignment, lists](basics.md)
1. [Control flow: if-else, loops](control.md)
1. [Strings and user input](strings.md)
<!-- 1. [Functions](functions.md) -->

**TODO** add sources to problems
